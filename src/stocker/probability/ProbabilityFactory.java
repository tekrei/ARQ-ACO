/**
 * A factory for probabilistic models. There are currently three models: (1) the
 * default model (2) the index model and (3) the data model. The default model
 * is a wrapper around both the index and the data model. Essentially, it merges
 * the *best* of both models. The index model requires a Jena model of the
 * specialized index to support joined triple pattern probability calculation.
 * The data model requires the Jena model of the queried ontology. Please note
 * that the data model returns probabilities only if the corresponding graph
 * implements the GraphStatisticsHandler. This is currently true only for
 * non-inference in-memory models. The probabilities returned by a Jena data
 * model which implements the GraphStatisticsHandler are the most accurate (i.e.
 * more accurate than the probabilities returned by the index model. However,
 * the data model allows probability calculation for triple patterns only (and
 * only for non-inference in-memory Jena models) whereas the index model allows
 * probability calculation for joined triple patterns and virtually for any Jena
 * model. The index model is however less accurate than the data model for
 * triple pattern probability calculation.
