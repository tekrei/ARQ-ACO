/**
 * The implementation for the probabilistic data model based on the Jena graph
 * statistics handler. This implementation provides accurate probabilities for
 * S, P or O by exploiting the information returned from the Jena graph
 * statistics handler about the number of triples matching either S, P or O. The
 * implementation allows probability calculation for single triples but not for
 * joined triples. Please note that for the implementation provided by this
 * class it is required that the ontology graph implements a Jena graph
 * statistics handler.
