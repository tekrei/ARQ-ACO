/**
 * The probabilistic default model does nothing special but it merges both the
 * probabilistic data and index model. In a nutshell, it uses the data model and
 * if the data model does not provide meaningful probability figures it uses the
 * index model. The probabilistic data model is not as powerful and versatile as
 * the probabilistic index model since it supports probability estimation only
 * for single triple patterns and only non-inference in-memory models (i.e. Jena
 * graphs that implement the GraphStatisticsHandler). However, the probabilistic
 * data model is more accurate than the index model when the graph statistics
 * handler is provided by the Jena graph. Hence, the implementation provided by
 * the probabilistic default model tries to integrate the best from both worlds.
