/**
 * This heuristic implements a simple variable counting technique to estimate
 * the execution cost of edges and nodes of graphs (i.e. BasicPatterns). If a
 * node of a triple pattern is an unbound variable, the cost 1.0 is assigned to
 * the node. Else, the node is bound and the cost 0.0 is assigned. Futher, S/P/O
 * nodes are weighted. The subject is weighted with 3, the predicate with 1 and
 * the object with 2. The weight considers that subjects are generally more
 * selective than predicates. Thus, the pattern ?s :p ?o should have a heigher
 * cost than the pattern :s ?p ?o.
 * 
 * This heuristic is executed if more sophisticated techniques cannot be used
 * because of the lack of indexes.

	 * The method returns the cost for the join between two triples for this

	 * OS is for instance less selective as a join over SS. Exotic joins like
	 * SP, PS, PP, PO, OP are considered high selective. This is probably very
	 * domain dependent, as most domains rarely define such exotic join types.
	 * Moreover, unbound joins are calculated to be less selective than bound
	 * joins, e.g. for (1) ?s1 ?p1 ?o1 . ?s1 ?p2 ?o2 (2) :s1 ?p1 ?o1 . :s1 ?p2
	 * ?o2 (2) is more selective. This method may be fine tuned for specific
